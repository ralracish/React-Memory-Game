# React-Memory-Game
React clicking memory game

This is a clicking memory game using React.  The application renders images of characters from the hit TV show Game of Thrones. The user clicks on an image, and must not click on the same image again. When the user clicks on an image, the images shuffle randomly. If the user clicks on a different image, then a message will show that the guess is correct and the score will increase by one. If the user clicks on an image more than once, then a message will show that the user guessed incorrectly and the game will start over with a score of 0.
